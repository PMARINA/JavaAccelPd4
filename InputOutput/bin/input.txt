US History II Midterm Review
Topics
A. Immigration
There were two general types of immigrants: New Immigrants and Old Immigrants. These groups’ names did not refer to the time at which they immigrated to America, but their ethnicity / the country the immigrated from. Old immigrants were more similar to the standard WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) family, came from NW Europe, and adjusted easily to the existing Americans, keeping America an ethnically homogenous Melting Pot. These immigrants came over in large numbers for the first time in the early to mid 1800s. New immigrants, however, were far from being WASP, spoke different languages, looked noticeably different, and had a cultural background far from anything like the typical WASP family, making it difficult for them to keep America an ethnically homogenous Melting Pot, and more like a heterogeneous Salad Bowl. These immigrants included groups from Latin America, SE Europe, and Asia, coming in large numbers for the first time in the late 1800s. Overall, immigration started out small, then peaked in 1900, and then decreased after that as nativism became more and more popular, until changes were made, and immigration began to increase again in the 1980s. However, throughout the Populist and Progressive eras, there were people who were supportive of immigrants, fighting for their safety and rights. Over time, the view on immigrants hasn’t changed much - America is still ambivalent on the issue. Some seem to be anti-Nativist, supportive of immigrants; an example would be Hillary Clinton. Trump, on the other hand, seems to believe that immigrants are “alien criminals”, and the reason that America is no longer a great country, displaying extremely Nativist views.
[COMBINED NEXT THREE QUESTIONS INTO ONE PARAGRAPH: OPINION, TREATMENT + GOV’T ACTIONS] The opinion of Americans regarding immigration fluctuated over the 19th and 20th century. When immigration first started in the early 1800s, with mostly Old Immigrants, it did not cause much distress among the American people. It was at the end of the 19th century, when immigration peaked that Americans began to worry, and nativism began to become more and more popular. In general terms, nativism was an anti-immigrant sentiment that wanted to decrease immigration in the US in order to keep America ethnically homogenous. Nativism was justified using Social Darwinism, the idea that some races were just believed to be stronger than others, and therefore to keep the nation strong, certain ethnicities (New Immigrants, to be specific) had to be kept out of the country. A comparison made was that letting New Immigrants into the country would be committing “race suicide”. Nativism usually bubbled to the surface again during economic downturns (CHARACTERISTIC OF THE GILDED AGE!!!!), as immigrants became the scapegoat for the economy’s problems; although, in reality, immigrants helped the economy by filling jobs in factories, and other somewhat low-paying jobs, that other WASP Americans were not willing to take. Unfortunately, Nativists pursued their beliefs by persuading the people and the gov’t that immigration was as bad as they made it to be. One act passed during this time included the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 where the US limited immigration, banning Chinese laborers from entering the country, and was not lifted until the US allied with China in WWI. Chinese laborers were targeted as a scapegoat when white miners complained after feeling threatened by the Chinese who did their job better than they did. Another way that Nativists furthered their beliefs was not only through prevention, but deterrence. This was ensured by treating immigrants like 2nd class citizens, to try and dissuade them from coming over, and advertising segregation, to portray a terrible life for certain immigrants to discourage them from immigrating to America.

B. Populism & Progressivism
Conditions of the Gilded Age that led to the Populist and Progressive Movements included the uneven distribution of wealth. Due to the large gap between the overwhelmingly wealthy and the painfully poor, Populists fought for more power for the people rather than to the privileged elite. Another characteristic of the Gilded Age that was a major factor in the start of the Populists and Progressivists were the periodic economic downturns, the Depression of 1893, especially. 
The goals and basic beliefs of the Populists were to reform the political and economic corruption that had created many conditions of the Gilded Age (economic downturns, uneven distribution of wealth). They believed that the privileged elite got special treatment, while the people suffered, as shown through conspicuous consumption. They generally sought for increased democracy, granting more political power to the people rather than to the privileged elite. Another goal that they wanted to achieve was a government of less laissez-faire capitalism by ensuring more regulations in order to protect consumers and workers. An example of this would be government ownership of the telegraph, telephone, and railroad, and a more centralized banking system (FED). The railroad system was especially important because most of those in the Populist party included Midwestern farmers who grew crops and needed to use railroads to ship their crops and receive goods. However, many railroads essentially had monopolies; therefore, the rates that farmers had to pay in order to do business and continue with trade were overwhelmingly high, which in turn negatively affected farmers’ businesses and incomes. Banks were also a major problem for farmers in the Populist party because many had taken out loans from banks to buy new, expensive, machinery. This new machinery led to more productive labor, and ultimately caused overproduction of crops, which was made even worse by retaliatory tariffs in Europe, which were in response to America’s high tariffs on international goods. The retaliatory tariffs caused agricultural prices to drop at the same time that railroad shipping costs were increased because of the monopolies. Therefore, when farmers were unable to pay off their loans because of the overproduction and tariffs, banks foreclosed on farms, leaving farmers homeless and unemployed. Another goal that the Populists worked towards was Free Silver, which was the unlimited coinage of silver, in hopes that it would cause more money to be circulated, which would in turn cause inflation. Inflation would benefit the people for once, instead of the privileged elites; especially those in debt, because the actual value of the money they owe would decrease, making it easier for them to pay off their loans. A graduated income tax was another thing that the Populists strived for so that taxes would be more fair for the people, since it did not make sense for the poor and the rich to be paying the same amount of tax when their incomes differed greatly. A secret ballot and a direct primary were two other things the Populists wanted to ensure their overall goal of increased democracy, and the demolition of political corruption. All of these goals were introduced at the Omaha Platform, a Populist Party convention in July of 1892.
The goals and basic beliefs of Progressives were to achieve increased democracy and more regulation (aka less laissez-faire capitalism), as did the Populists. However, the Progressives also sought for social justice, the idea that everyone deserves an equal social, political, and economic opportunity. They also believed that that industrialization and urbanization had created both benefits and problems that humans are capable of fixing, and therefore could improve society with the help of the gov’t, as it was their responsibility to help and address these arising problems. Although there are many similarities between the Progressives and the Populists, the Progressives were populist, as far as their ideals go, but they were not Populist, in that they were not a third political party. Progressives were more moderate and realistic, taking the philosophy of populism, but instead of applying it to midwesterners, they applied it to urban issues, including the lives of immigrants and factory workers. They also supported capitalism, but strived to reform many aspects of the lives of the middle / lower class including urban living conditions, working conditions, gov’t reform, women’s right, consumer protection, temperance, and children’s issues.
The achievements of Populists (16.3, page 533) and Progressives (ch. 17) were numerous. Populists gained more than one million votes for the presidency in the election of 1892, which is impressive for a new political party. Furthermore, the Populists elected 3 governors, 5 senators, and 10 congressmen, continuing to gain seats in state legislatures and in turn prompting the other two major political parties to consider Populist ideals. Although after the four year depression in 1893, the Populist party died out and most supporters returned to the Democratic party, they left a legacy that the Progressives would pick up. The achievements of Progressives were even more numerous than that of the Populists. Muckraking was a major factor in the start of their achievements. Books such as How the Other Half Lives, and Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle exposed the horrors of the conditions workers faced, shocking the faces of American people. Progressives went on to petition for reform in many aspects of middle / lower class life. For urban living conditions, settlement houses were established to provide the poor with healthier housing and education, offering social services to the poor, promoting education, especially for women. Childcare was also provided when parents went to work. NYC passed building codes to promote safety and health, requiring the hiring of inspectors to see that standards set were met. In addition, many states passed laws regulating workplace safety, injured worker compensation, and the length of a work day. The Progressives also achieved what the Populists wanted concerning the direct primary, ensuring that all but four states had a direct primary by 1916. Initiative, recall, and referendum was also initiated in most states. The 17th Amendment was also passed, allowing a direct popular election of Senators. In 1920, the 19th Amendment was passed, giving women the right to vote. In addition, more than one million birth control clinics were established in the US, although advertisement remained illegal, supported greatly by Margaret Sanger. For consumer protection, the US Food and Drug Administration was established, and the Pure Food and Drug Act and Meat Inspection Act was put into action to put a stop to usury, misbranding, and enforce basic food/drug regulations. Temperance classes were required in all public schools, and the 18th Amendment was passed, outlawing production and sale of alcohol, resulting in a 30% drop in consumption. Finally, Congress passed the Keating-Owens Act, banning child labor, supported greatly by Mary “Mother” Jones, and although it was later declared unconstitutional, by 1910, 72% of children were attending school; and in 1918, all states passed a law that stated that all children had to attend at least elementary school. Furthermore, political figures such as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson took on positions as Progressive governors, later taking even more powerful positions as President, continuing with their Progressive ideals. Such was shown in Roosevelt’s Square Deal, which goal was to keep the wealthy and powerful from taking advantage of small business owners, and the poor, and also in Wilson’s New Freedom plan, which placed strict gov’t controls on corporations. Wilson also went on to persuade Congress to create the Federal Trade Commission and pass the Sherman Anti-Trust Act to strengthen and enforce antitrust laws, explicitly spelling out activities in which businesses could and could not engage in.



C. Imperialism
The rationales of American Imperialism were economic gain, Mahanism, righteousness, and social darwinism. Each rationale has their own significance. [FIRST FOUR PARAGRAPHS COMBINES FIRST TWO QUESTIONS: THE RATIONALE + EXAMPLES OF ACTIONS TAKEN DUE TO SAID RATIONALE]
To start off, economic gain was to spread new markets, increase raw materials, and to gain investment opportunities through the protection of American investments and encouragement of the creation of new ones. Albert J Beveridge was a Progressive friend of Theodore Roosevelt, and argued that America was producing more than what they can use, and that she must find “new markets for our produce, new occupation for our capital, [and] new work for our labor.” An action taken to achieve this occurred in 1867, when William Seward (the secretary of state) bought Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million. Journalists thought it was this purchase was useless because Alaska was just a vast tundra of snow and ice. The purchase turned out to double the size of America, and Alaska happened to be rich in timber, oil, and lots of other natural resources. This increased the importation of raw materials. Another action taken is when Wilson (president at the time) was worried that Germany would occupy Haiti and threaten the Panama canal along with other American investments. Wilson sends marines to Haiti to restore order and maintain economic and political stability in order to protect the investments. America also gives Haiti a new president, who supported American interests. This allows America to draft the Haitian-American treaty, giving America control of Haitian finances.
The idea of Mahanism originates from the naval officer Alfred Mahan, who urged American leaders to build up a strong army and a modernized fleet. He argued the creation of a canal across Central America is necessary for the ability of ships to move quickly between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Lastly, he included that America would need to acquire naval bases in Cuba, Hawaii and Philippines where American ships could refuel and gather fresh supplies. Due to Mahanism, an action was taken when America thought that the price for the Panama Canal proposed by the Colombian government was too high. Roosevelt (president at the time) sends US battle ships to help aid a rebellion that the Panamanian people were leading against the Colombian government. In return for their victory of independence, Panama agreed to give the US the canal zone for a lower price. The canal cut 8000 miles off a trip from east coast to west coast of the US. Another example takes place when Commodore Matthew Perry sends a fleet of American warships to present-day Tokyo Bay in Japan. Perry had the intent of taking possession of the Midway Islands. He won the Japanese emperor’s favor by giving him many luxurious goods. There then is a treaty in 1875 gives the US the right to build a naval base at pearl harbor.
American leaders believed that it was their duty to spread America’s advanced way of life to the “inferior” people of the world. Righteousness justified any interventions made by America by saying that they were actually helping the countries/nations that they were attempting to colonize. This was America’s way of saying “you’re welcome” to the people of the world for spreading the ideas of protestant christianity, democracy, education, technology, and capitalism. One example of Righteousness was the creation of the Platt Amendment. Although the Teller Amendment stated that America was not allowed to build an empire out of Cuba, America did not want to let Cuba go after fighting the Spanish American War. America convinced Cuba to add the Platt Amendment to their constitution, which allowed America to have some control over Cuba without colonizing them. This was justified because America believed that they were helping the inferior race by building schools, setting finances in order, and making progress to eliminate yellow fever in that area (however, the amendment did place severe limitations on Cubans). A second example is also when the US sends troops to Mexico. Mexicans were leading a revolt against their leaders and foreign investors who were robbing the Mexican people by keeping themselves wealthy. Wilson (president at the time) and other Americans were initially worried about their investments, so he intervened by sending troops into Mexico. However, his idea of Moral Diplomacy was to convince people as though it was his entitlement to help replace a new leader and teach the South American republics to elect better leaders, rejecting the economic gains as the reason of his intervention (but it was still the initial reason for intervening in the first place).
Imperialists in America believed in national superiority, based off of the idea of being the “fittest for survival,” or otherwise known as Social Darwinism. This was the belief that life, or in this case, nations, were in constant competition against one another to be the fittest, or most powerful. Social Darwinism felt that there was entitlement, meaning that a certain country’s ability to rule over the weaker people was proof that they were destined to be the superior country. The idea also believed that the subjugation of others resulted in higher rankings, and that America had to Imperialize in order to avoid becoming colonized by Europe, and to stay on top. Righteousness and Social Darwinism tie themselves together because Social Darwinism is about how some countries/nations are superior over another, meaning that an inferior country exists. Righteousness gives America a reason to help out the inferior country as a “big brother” or “sister.” An action occurs after Americans defeated Spain in the Spanish American War and won the Philippines for $20 million. McKinley (president at the time) annexes the Philippines, claiming in a diary journal entry that they were “unfit for self-government” which also meant that they were inferior and had to spread their democracy to them (some righteousness). The Filipinos had thought that they gained independence, causing Emilio Aguinaldo to lead an insurrection, or rebellion, for independence. During this Filippino war, America uses tactics such as guerilla warfare to prove their superiority over the Philippines, and Aguinaldo was captured. Another example occurs at the creation of the Roosevelt Corollary. The Monroe Doctrine was put in place to forbid European countries to intervene in Latin American countries. When Latin Americans could not pay their debt to their foreign investors, Germany and Britain blockaded Venezuelan ports to ensure the debts were to be paid. This put a concern on the stability of the Panama Canal, because if the canal was unstable, this could provide an opportunity for a European power to steal the canal.  With this, Roosevelt updated the Monroe Doctrine with the Roosevelt Corollary, stating that America would now become the police power of Latin America. Roosevelt said that “if we intend to say hands off to the powers of Europe, than sooner or later we must keep order ourselves.” Becoming involved with and intervening with Latin America was a way for America to stay on top, in order to prevent Europe from overcoming and pushing America’s rank down.
Because of America’s history with British Parliament and the colonization of America from the British, America did not feel that it was right to formally create an empire by colonizing other countries. In order to not obtain a formal empire, America created an informal empire. To do this, America greatly influenced a country or nation without directly governing them as a colony. America used many investments and trade connections to protect its interests in that colony, while leaving the weaker nation “technically” independent. Through this, America gained the territories of the following (in no particular order): the Philippines (before annexation), Cuba, Puerto Rico, Pacific Island of Guam, Haiti, Mexico for some time, Latin America, and Midway Islands (Hawaii before the annexation).
There were many different foreign policies used by each different president during this imperialistic time period. Theodore Roosevelt pursued imperialism through big stick diplomacy. Roosevelt had an admiration for the saying “speak softly and carry a big stick.” This diplomacy aimed at making other nations fear challenged against America using a big navy. Roosevelt favored Mahanism, and thought that it was the most important characteristic in American Imperialism. Roosevelt most likely used the military power when carrying out imperialist events. William Taft pursed dollar diplomacy. Taft made a comment in 1912, looking to substitute “dollars for bullets.” His policy aimed at increasing American investments in businesses and banks. Taft thought that the economic gain was the most important out of the four rationales of imperialism. Taft most likely created new markets, gained raw materials, and protected American interests in order to carry out his imperialistic events. Woodrow Wilson uses the foreign policy of moral diplomacy. Wilson promises to “work to promote human rights, national integrity, and opportunity.” Wilson later on sought for his Fourteen Points to become established, emphasizing “peace without victory.” His diplomacy aimed at establishing ‘friendship’ between America and other countries, and becoming imperialistic without the exploitation of others. Wilson favored righteousness the most, for it used the most moral reasoning for imperialism.



D. WWI - Causes & Outcome
Although America was technically neutral during this time in that they did not join the war, there was a clear favor throughout the country that they sided with the Allies long before they declared war. One cause of this was that there was many vested interests with America and the Allies. Americans had personal stakes in the outcome of the war that they weren’t directly involved in. As a result, Americans usually took biased actions that ensured their desired outcome, for the Central Powers to lose. America believed that life would be better, and that America would benefit with the victory of the Allied Powers in numerous ways. That personal stake was mostly the financial stake that America had with Britain, for Britain was their leading trading partner. If America joins the war and helps Britain reach a victory, America would get repaid back all of the money that Britain owes. If they remain neutral without helping, and Britain loses, America will not get the money back for a while. America’s trading leaders (munition businesses, gun factories, banks, etc.) expected to be repaid after the war, and if they didn’t receive those payments then there was a possibility of an economic downturn since they greatly affect America’s economy. Sympathy for the Allies were common for Americans to have (rather than sympathy for the Central Powers) because of propaganda. It was easier for British propaganda to present itself to Americans because there was no language barrier since they both speak the same language. There was propaganda in movie making, newspapers, and other forms of media. This made Americans lean towards the side of the Allies rather than the Central Powers. The propaganda made the Central Powers look evil, or the bad guys, and although they were brutal, they were not as extreme as the propaganda brought them up to be. Nevertheless, Americans believed that the Central Powers were dangerous, and that Germany was a possible threat to America, and could attack America with their unrestricted marine warfare. Some Social Darwinism ties into this, where America did not want Germany to become more powerful than them and attack the US. During the war, Russia has its own Russian Revolution. Due to this, Russia pulls out of the war, causing Germany’s two front war to turn into one front. This gave a lead to Germany, because now they didn’t have to split their military in half (one half per each of the two fronts). To America, Russia pulling out of the war seemed like another huge threat from Germany to America. During the Revolutionary War, the French General Marquis de Lafayette aided American causes. During WWI, after America joined the war, General Pershing remarked “Lafayette, we are here!” Although he said this after the nation already declared war, the General as well as others felt as though it was America’s duty to repay the debt of aiding each other in a war back to France. With all of this false neutrality in America, the events that actually led up to America declaring war made the decision a lot easier than without the bias throughout America. As mentioned before, Germany was using unrestricted marine warfare with ships called U-boats. Because the boats could fully submerge underwater, it was hard to tell when they were coming. Before America declared war, Germany had sank the Lusitania, a British passenger ship, killing many Americans aboard it. This incident angered America, so Germany promised not to sink unarmed passenger ships without warning. Germany violated that promise by sinking another passenger ship (a French one) called Sussex. The American people were once again angry for the deaths of more Americans, so Germany issued the Sussex Pledge, which promised to not sink unarmed ships (again). This put Wilson and the rest of America on the edge, already preparing an army just in case Wilson asks Congress to declare war. At first, America wants to remain neutral in order to trade with every country involved in the war, not just with one side. Leading up to America’s declaration of war, there was a realization that the profits made from trading with the Allied Powers were five times as much as the amount made from trading with the Central Powers. At that point, it didn’t seem as great of a risk to side with the Allies and join the war since (compared to the amount of money made from the Allies,) America wouldn’t losing much money in doing so. The final event leading right up to the involvement of America in World War I was the publication of the Zimmerman Note. Germany sent a telegram to Mexico that in summary, asked Mexico to declare on America if America declared war on Germany. The telegram was intercepted by the British, and knowing that by giving American authorities this note, would push them into joining the war and joining the Allied Powers with Britain. The British willingly gave America the note, and President Wilson and the rest of America was shocked. America now had a threat from Germany and Mexico (even though most leaders knew that Mexico had no intention of attacking the US, they didn’t want to take any chances). Thus, Wilson finally asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany.
Many Americans did not want to join the war for various reasons. Wilson (president at the time) encouraged that Americans be “neutral in fact as well as name...impartial in thoughts as well as action.” He wanted the American people to not just be neutral in what they say and what they do, but to truly be neutral in their thoughts and actions. The war was already taking place, and America knew that the war was a deadly stalemate in action, meaning that neither side was getting any progress due to the deadly warfares used, like trench or gas warfare. Because of this, America could not tell which side could potentially win the war since neither side had taken lead over the other. The argument was that if America was to join the war, they would not have a prediction on whether the side they picked would win, and America couldn’t risk that. Americans also recognized that (to their knowledge) there were no direct interests that involved them, or affects them. The American population was “melting pot,” which meant that a huge number of immigrants from different parts of Europe, specifically Irish Americans, German Americans, etc. Joining the war would cause the fear of essentially setting Americans up against one another. Remaining neutral to the war would avoid conflicts to break out between the American citizens. In the beginning of America’s history, British Parliament controlled America as a colony, and Americans hated that. Traditional American isolation from European countries was an idea presented in Washington’s farewell address, and joining the war would go against his wish. Joining the war would also make Americans hypocrites because of the irony of them becoming involved with European countries’ disputes. Wilson was an idealist, and wanted to keep America peaceful. Staying away from the war was the way that he thought was productive in achieving that. With a war going on, this fortunately helped benefit America’s economy, because countries and nations fighting in the war now had a demand for war munitions, food, etc. By staying neutral, America had the opportunity to trade with every country involved in the war. Picking a side and joining the war would eliminate trading with the opponents, and America would be making less money than if it remained neutral.
After the war ended, Wilson, being an idealist, wanted “peace of justice.” Wilson’s vision for the post-war World was displayed throughout his proposed peace treaty, The Fourteen Points. He addresses that he had America fight in this war to “end all wars;” to get rid of anything and prevent all that could cause another war. Wilson believed that the only way to achieve this would be through peace. One of Wilson’s main aims in his Fourteen Points was self-determination. This was the idea that the people had the right to choose their own form of government. Another main aim was to give a spirit of forgiveness to Germany. Wilson does not want to exploit the losing power (Germany), and “does not wish to injure” them with any intent. Wilson says that “peace without victory” is required. In his more specific and particular goals, Wilson wanted to end the creation of secret treaties, freedom of the seas, the removal of economic barriers for trade, and reduction of the size of national armies and navies. Wilson also sought for the world to adjust colonial claims with fairness toward colonial peoples. The thing that Wilson wanted the most was the creation of the League of Nations.The league was to create an organization that would keep peace around the world by encouraging members and national leaders to solve problems through negotiations. 
The Treaty of Versailles met some of the goals made by Wilson in his Fourteen Points. The League of Nations was acquired, as well as the reduction of the sizes of armies.
Most of Wilson’s other goals were not met through the treaty. However, the biggest point that was missed and that did not get through to the treaty was the spirit of forgiveness for Germany. The Treaty of Versailles was known as the “treaty of vengeance,” and through it, one of its main aims was to make Germany pay reparations for World War I,  placing the entire war’s blame on them. These reparations were to make Germany weak so that they weren’t strong, or a threat, to avoid future invasion.
Although Wilson presents and invents the League of Nations, the Senate ultimately rejects the signing of the treaty. The reasons for this was that the senators were split into the irreconcilable and the reservationists. Both groups opposed the treaty because of article 10 of the League covenant, which called for mutual defense by the signers of the treaty, a pledge that each nation would “respect and preserve...the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all the Members of the League.” The irreconcilables claimed that America should not get entangled in world politics, whereas the reservationists thought that article 10 could lead the US into a war without the consent of Congress. Reservationists also thought that the wording was too vague. When the Senate brought two different treaties that aimed at solving the issues presented by the irreconcilables, and ones by the reservationists, Wilson did not want to compromise and told his Democratic followers to vote against both of them (so both of those treaties failed) The irreconcilables and reservationists did not like the original treaty because of article 10, and when the Senate presented it, the irreconcilables and reservationists voted against it and overpowered the votes made for it by Wilson’s supporters. 


E. WWI - American Involvement
America mobilized for war by strengthening and mobilizing their Men, Money, Materials, and Minds. As America prepared her homefront, regulations were passed and committees formed to ensure that soldiers fighting abroad would be supported, and an Allied victory ensured against the Central Powers. Congress passed the Selective Service Act to draft men to fight in the war, although many voluntary joined. The Council of National Defense further prepared the country for war. The Fuel / Food Administration was an agency that regulated food production, coal and petroleum distribution, and railroad use in order to conserve for the war. This was further enforced by the War Industries Board that determined and regulated what products industries would make, where those products went, and how much they would cost.The Committee on Public Information used propaganda to “brainwash” the American people into supporting the war effort so that they would be more willing to participate in voluntary actions that would help to ensure an Allied victory, including women, Braceros, and African Americans moving into the workforce to replace current soldiers’ jobs (known for the African Americans moving North as the Great Migration), conserving food, buying war bonds, and growing “victory gardens”. In addition, the Espionage Act and the Sedition Act was passed to try and ensure that no one would speak out against the war efforts in any form. Because of the war, and women stepping up to maintain a stable economy at home while their male loved ones were off fighting the war, eventually provoked Wilson to persuade Congress to give women the vote. 
During the war, gov’t power changed in that they stopped being as laissez-faire as they were before the war, creating what some would look at as a double standard. Before the war, when Progressives and Populists fought for a less laissez-faire capitalist gov’t, the gov’t had refused at some points to help the individuals dying and suffering because they claimed they were laissez-faire capitalist. However, as soon as a war breaks out, regulations come up everywhere, for the good of the nation. Such is shown through the regulation of costs of food and products that corporations produced. 



F. Regulation
Regulation is when the government regulates private businesses/individuals by telling them what the must do, and what they can not do. The responsibility of the government is to protect all citizens’ life, liberty, and property. Regulation is the opposite of laissez faire capitalism, which argues whether or not the government should interfere or get involved in things. Regulation is achieved through passing laws that set requirements. It is also achieved through creating agencies to oversee that there is enforcement of the law. Punishments for companies that violate the law also helps achieve regulation.
The argument in favor of regulation is that regulation will help to aid and create a stable economy for a long period of time. Regulation protects the interests of the consumers, so they favor it because it helps with things such as prices, quality of products, and access to products. Workers favor regulation because they too are protected because regulation helps with fair wages, working conditions, and benefit packages (paid leave). There is an extent of protection of the citizens from the negative effects from particular businesses or industries, such as pollution to the environment. Small businesses favor regulation of big businesses because it gives them a more fair chance to compete. The argument against regulation is that when the government regulates, it weakens the overall economy and hurts the people that it’s supposed to benefit. It is said that regulation will actually cause businesses to raise prices and/or hire fewer workers. It prevents the growth of new businesses, and it wastes money for creating the agencies. Regulation benefits the bigger companies from the expenses of the smaller ones because the smaller businesses can’t afford to follow the regulations, and the big businesses could influence the regulatory agencies with their power and money. Big businesses aren’t in favor of regulation because they make less money with regulations. For example, if there is a regulation that limits and decreases the working hours of a corporation, they will be making less produce without their workers and will be making less money everyday.
During the Gilded Age, there wasn’t much regulation because the economy was in a state of laissez-faire capitalism. This meant that the government went “hands off” and didn’t interfere with the economy. With that being said, no regulations were passed because the government was not available to pass any laws regarding big businesses. 
Regulating big businesses was a goal of Populists and Progressives, and that’s why during the Populist and Progressive Era, a huge amount of regulations were passed. When Theodore Roosevelt was president, he had actually created the Progressive Party. Some issues that were regulated in the era are as follows: urban living conditions, government reform, children’s issues, women’s rights, consumer protections, temperance, and working conditions. All of these issues reached some sort of achievement where a law was passed in favor of reducing these problems, and agencies created to make sure that businesses followed the law, with punishments if they violated the law. Muckrakers helped greatly to achieve these goals using exaggeration in investigative reports. This was used to shock and outrage readers, forcing them to do something about the issue. There were many pieces of literature written about each of these issues that brought awareness to it.
During World War I, a huge regulation that was passed was the 19th amendment, granting women’s suffrage. There was debate whether or not the National Women’s Party should continue to fight and picket protest daily in front of the White House in times of war, because it was believed that protests for regulations should come to a halt in order to support the country and the president in a time of need. Although some of the Party stopped protesting during war time, some women still continued to fight for what they needed. Alice Paul, Lucy Burns (leaders of the NWP) and the rest of the Party eventually got President Wilson in support of women’s suffrage, and Congress ratified the 19th amendment.
